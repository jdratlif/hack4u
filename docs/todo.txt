| hack4u TODO List
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hack4u implements the set of features I set out to create with this program. It
is effectively version 1.0, but to remain consistent with the versioning scheme
I've chosen, it is 0.90. 0.90 means a not well tested 1.0. I'm 99% positive it
works the way it looks and should react the way you expect. But of course in
a project like this, there could possibly be some bugs to fix. If none are found
in a set period of time (I'm thinking 6 months), then the program will become
1.0.

Nevertheless, there are some things I've thought about implementing that may or
may not have been on my original list that I decided weren't that important for
one reason or another. I may or may not implement these or other things in the
program, but here is a list of things I'd like to see happen.

- add internal help

  The list is in order of decreasing importantance (to me at least). As you can
  see, documentation is at the top of my list, though I think the program is
  fairly intuitive in and of itself.

- edit the characters waiting in the hostel

  I originally meant for the program to allow you to edit the characters who had
  joined your party (as opposed to the ones just in your party), but I forgot to
  search for the address where this is stored. Since I'd already designed the
  GUI framework by the time I remembered this, it seemed a waste of time.

- edit pirate ships & baloon locations

  This might be a good idea if I get around to it.
