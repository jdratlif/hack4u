- Introduction -
----------------

  hack4u is a tool for editing save state files for Ultima: Quest of the
  Avatar on the NES. It was released as Ultima II on the NES, but it is
  actually the fourth game in the series, hence the program's name.
  
  You can take the battery backed RAM files created by Nintendo emulators such
  as FCEU, Nesten, Nestopia, VirtuaNES, and more and modify them. These files
  have the extention .SAV and are usually named the same as your ROM file. So if
  your Ultima IV ROM is named "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).zip", which is
  the GoodNES name for one of the known Ultima IV dumps, then your SRAM file
  is probably "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).sav". FCEU adds the ROM checksum
  value by default to its files, so on FCEU, it might have a long string of
  extra characters before the .SAV.

- Installation -
----------------

  Binaries are available for Windows (2000 and later), Linux (requires GTK+ >=
  2.0), and Mac OS X (Tiger or later). The source is also available if you want
  to compile it yourself.
  
  To compile, you will need a modern C++ compiler and wxWidgets 2.8 or later.
  
  On most platforms, compiling is as easy as opening a terminal and running
  ./configure && make. That should work on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows with
  mingw/msys. There are also Visual Studio project files in the vstudio
  directory.
  
  For more complete compilation instructions, consult our compiling HOWTO at
  http://games.technoplaza.net/compile.php.

---------
- Usage -
---------

  Using the program should be fairly straightforward. Start the program hack4u
  either by double-clicking or from the command line.
  
  Load the SRAM .SAV file. For FCEU on Windows, this is in the FCEU directory
  in the SAV subdirectory. For FCEU on Unix, this is in the ~/.fceu directory. I
  don't know about other emulators. The program should work on any emulator that
  uses the battery backed RAM (SRAM).
  
  Once the file is open, it will load the first save game it finds. Ultima used
  three save slots, and you can edit any of the three that are available. I
  assume in most cases this will be the the first game "Game1". You can choose
  a different save slot from the Game menu. If any are greyed out, that means
  they are not valid. You must have at least one save in SRAM to edit, or the
  program will not be able to edit anything. We can only make changes to
  existing files. We cannot generate them.
  
  There are five tabs, "Hero", "Party", "Inventory", "Transporation", and
  "Character". They will allow you to edit almost any part of the game. Items
  you have, your characters stats, magic you know, etc.
  
  I have added editing of nearly everything I consider remotely useful. If there
  is something you want to be able to edit that you cannot, contact me and I'll
  see what I can do.
  
  When you load a .SAV file, it will make a backup in a file named the same as
  your SRAM file with a .bak on the end. If something goes wrong when you try
  to start your edited game, just delete the SRAM file and rename the backup to
  .sav instead of .sav.bak.

- Notes -
---------

  Some important things to be aware of.
  
  - This is BETA software. Your use of it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take no
    responsibility if this program screws up your Ultima Data, or any other
    thing on your or any other computer. I'm pretty sure it won't, but don't
    blame me if it does!
    
  - The program checks for valid values in most cases, but I'm not altogether
    sure all the ranges I put in are correct. Contact me if you feel a valid
    value is being ignored by the program.
    
  - You can create some invalid combinations. Equipping two weapons, bows, or
    armors, or duplicating party members (e.g. two Paladins, two Fighters). The
    program will warn you about these, but will not prevent you from using them.
    None of these combinations seem to *adversely* affect the game, but I've
    only tested these for a short time.
    
    Duplicating Party Members: Since each member has stats for their class, if
    you use duplicate party members, all stats are shared, including current HP,
    and MP. If one member would die, the duplicates may die too. However, since
    the game has to check for death conditions, depending upon order of death,
    the one who died may be brought back to life. Duplicate at your own risk.
    
    Equipping Multiple Items: I didn't notice any problems with this. The game
    seems to notice only the first item you equip, but since it was never
    intended, there may be problems I didn't notice.
    
  - I've never heard of the 'Wheel' or the 'Dagger'. Neither seem to be of much
    use, but maybe I just didn't know what to do with them.
    
  - Virtues
  
    I don't know exactly what ranges correspond to what "ranks" (very poor,
    poor, well, very well), but I do know that 0 is bad and 100 is good (partial
    avatarhood). So 99 is the best you can be without being the avatar. It seems
    to be broken down as follows (but I haven't tested this reliably):
    
    0-24 Very Poor
    25-49 Poor
    50-74 Well
    75-98 Very Well
    99    Worth of Avatarhood
    100   Partial Avatarhood
