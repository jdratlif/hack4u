- Introduction -
----------------

  hack4u is a tool for editing save state files for Ultima: Quest of the
  Avatar on the NES. It was released as Ultima II on the NES, but it is
  actually the fourth game in the series, hence the program's name.
  
  You can take the battery backed RAM files created by Nintendo emulators such
  as FCEU, Nesten, Nestopia, VirtuaNES, and more and modify them. These files
  have the extention .SAV and are usually named the same as your ROM file. So if
  your Ultima IV ROM is named "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).zip", which is
  the GoodNES name for one of the known Ultima IV dumps, then your SRAM file
  is probably "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).sav". FCEU adds the ROM checksum
  value by default to its files, so on FCEU, it might have a long string of
  extra characters before the .SAV.

- Installation -
----------------

  For Windows, Linux, and Mac OS-X, I have provided a binary version. You should
  be able to download it and double-click the hack4u executable to start the
  program.
  
  On Windows and Mac OS-X, there shouldn't be any extra dependencies required.
  For the Linux binary, you will need GTK+. There are two versions, one for
  GTK+ 1.2, and another for GTK+ 2.0.
  
  For all other platforms, you will need to compile the source code yourself. It
  shouldn't be too hard to compile. It is expected to compile on any nearly
  any Unix.
  
  To compile the source, you will need an ISO C++ compiler (I recommend GNU G++
  >= 3.3), and the wxWidgets library. You can compile under wxWidgets 2.4.2, but
  >= 2.5.3 is recommended due to vast improvements to wxWidgets since 2.4.2
  not the least of which is the XRC system. You can download the wxWidgets
  library at http://www.wxwidgets.org/.
  
  After you have wxWidgets installed, you should be able to do something like
  this:
  
  ./configure && make
  
  This should produce a program hack4u in the source subdirectory. If it
  doesn't, contact me and we'll talk about it.
  
  You can use make install to install the program, but it's not a perfect
  solution yet as I can't seem to figure out how to install the XRC file where
  I want. So currently, the XRC file doesn't get installed. There are a few
  options:
  
  a) specify the path to the XRC file manually at runtime
     hack4u /path/to/xrc/hack4u.xrc
     
  b) set a default path and put the XRC file there
     ./configure XRC_PREFIX=/usr/share/hack4u
     make && make install
     mkdir /usr/share/hack4u && cp source/xrc/hack4u.xrc /usr/share/hack4u
     
  c) accept the default XRC prefix (./xrc) and put the XRC file there
     mkdir /path/to/binary/xrc && cp source/xrc/hack4u.xrc /path/to/binary/xrc
  
  The binary package uses option C cause that's just easiest if you don't care
  about putting binaries and share files in separate locations. If you do, then
  I'd pick B.
  
  Fortunately, starting with version 0.90, the program will no longer crash if
  the XRC file isn't found. It will give an error message on the console and
  exit gracefully.
  
  I am working on a gentoo ebuild, but they get added very slowly, so it may
  take some time before it is added to portage. Still, if you use gentoo, you
  might try 'emerge hack4u' and see what happens.
  
  Compiling on wxWidgets 2.4.2 requires not only that you build wxWidgets, but
  also the XRC library which was not built by default in 2.4.2. To do this, go
  to your wxWidgets build directory in the contrib/src/xrc directory and do a
  make && make install. When compiling hack4u, you will need to specify the
  library. Under Linux, I was able to do the following:
  
  ./configure LIBS="-lwx_gtk2-2.4 -lwx_gtk2_xrc-2.4" && make
  
  Under Linux with GTK+ 2.0.49. I don't know if the same procedure would work
  under mingw or cygwin for Linux or not. The library name would obviously be
  different. As I mentioned, if you use 2.5.3, this won't be a problem.
  
  If you compile with wxWidgets 2.4.2, you will get a warning about wxCLOSE_BOX
  not being recognized when you start the program. This message can be safely
  ignored.

---------
- Usage -
---------

  Using the program should (I hope) be fairly straightforward. Start the program
  hack4u either by double-clicking or from the command line.
  
  Load the SRAM .SAV file. For FCEU on Windows, this is in the FCEU directory
  in the SAV subdirectory. For FCEU on Unix, this is in the ~/.fceu directory. I
  don't know about other emulators. The program should work on any emulator that
  uses the battery backed RAM (SRAM).
  
  Once the file is open, it will load the first save game it finds. Ultima used
  three save slots, and you can edit any of the three that are available. I
  assume in most cases this will be the the first game "Game1". You can choose
  a different save slot from the Game menu. If any are greyed out, that means
  they are not valid. You must have at least one save in SRAM to edit, or the
  program will not be able to edit anything. We can only make changes to
  existing files. We cannot generate them.
  
  There are three tabs, "General", "Inventory", and "Character". They will allow
  you to edit almost any part of the game. Items you have, your characters
  stats, magic you know, etc.
  
  The one thing that cannot yet be edited (that I plan to implement) is
  characters waiting in Britannia's Hostel. If there is something you want to be
  able to edit that you cannot, contact me and I'll see what I can do.
  
  When you load a .SAV file, it will make a backup in a file named the same as
  your SRAM file with a .bak on the end. If something goes wrong when you try
  to start your edited game, just delete the SRAM file and rename the backup to
  .sav instead of .sav.bak.

- Notes -
---------

  Some important things to be aware of.
  
  - This is BETA software. Your use of it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take no
    responsibility if this program screws up your Ultima Data, or any other
    thing on your or any other computer. I'm pretty sure it won't, but don't
    blame me if it does!
    
  - The program checks for valid values in most cases, but I'm not altogether
    sure all the ranges I put in are correct. Contact me if you feel a valid
    value is being ignored by the program.
    
  - You can create some invalid combinations. Having a blank between party
    members, equipping two weapons or bows or armors, or duplicating party
    members (e.g. two Paladins, two Fighters). The program will warn you about
    these, but will not prevent you from using them. None of these combinations
    seem to *adversely* affect the game, but I've only tested a few for about
    a minute each.
    
    Duplicating Party Members: Since each member has stats for their class, if
    you use duplicate party members, all stats are shared, including current HP,
    and MP. If one member would die, all duplicates die too.
    
    Blank inbetween Members: This looks neat to have a blank walking around, but
    it will prevent members after the blank from having their stats displayed in
    battle. I noticed no other adverse affects, but I only tested a short time.
    
    Equipping Multiple Items: I didn't notice any problems with this. The game
    seems to notice only the first item you equip, but since it was never
    intended, there may be problems I didn't notice.
    
  - Taking away items you already found in your quest will not let you
    "rediscover" these items. They are gone as far as the game knows. This
    probably means things you add can still be found. I don't know what impact
    this might have on gameplay if you do either one.
    
  - I've never heard of the 'Wheel' or the 'Dagger'. Neither seem to be of much
    use, but maybe I just didn't know what to do with them.
    
  - Virtues
  
    I don't know what ranges correspond to what "ranks" (very poor, poor, well,
    very well), but I do know that 0 is bad and 100 is good (avatar in fact).
    So 99 is the best you can be without being the avatar. 100 will give you
    partial avatarhood in that virtue. 100 in all should make you the avatar.
