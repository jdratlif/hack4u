- Introduction -
----------------

  hack4u is a tool for editing save state files for Ultima: Quest of the
  Avatar on the NES. It was released as Ultima II on the NES, but it is
  actually the fourth game in the series, hence the program's name.
  
  You can take the battery backed RAM files created by Nintendo emulators such
  as FCEU, Nesten, Nestopia, VirtuaNES, and more and modify them. These files
  have the extention .SAV and are usually named the same as your ROM file. So if
  your Ultima IV ROM is named "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).zip", which is
  the GoodNES name for one of the known Ultima IV dumps, then your SRAM file
  is probably "Ultima - Quest of the Avatar (U).sav". FCEU adds the ROM checksum
  value by default to its files, so on FCEU, it might have a long string of
  extra characters before the .SAV.

- Installation -
----------------

  For Windows, I have provided a binary version. You should be able to download
  this and double-click the hack4u.exe executable to start the program.
  
  For all other platforms, you will need to compile the source code yourself. It
  should be able to be compiled on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS-X, and any Unix that
  supports the Gnome Toolkit.
  
  To compile the source, you will need an ISO C++ compiler (I recommend GNU G++
  >= 3.3), and the wxWidgets library. I believe hack4u will compile under
  wxWidgets 2.4.2, but I have only tested it under 2.5.3, so I would recommend
  at least that version. Why use the development version? Two reaons. First,
  XRC is not compiled into wxWidgets by default, and I don't like extra steps.
  Second, even though it is called the "development" version, the authors
  themselves release commercial software based on 2.5.3 (like Julian Smart's
  DialogBlocks 1.83). You can download the wxWidgets library at
  http://www.wxwidgets.org.
  
  After you have wxWidgets installed, you should be able to do something like
  this:
  
  ./configure && make
  
  This will (*should*) produce a program hack4u in the source subdirectory. If
  it doesn't, well, contact me and we'll talk about it.
  
  Note: make install will currently not install the XRC files necessary to run
  the program, so if you install somewhere, you need to create a directory xrc
  and copy the hack4u.xrc file from source/xrc there. In other words, the binary
  needs a path structure like this:
  
  /my/path/to/hack4u
    /bin
      - hack4u
      /xrc
        - hack4u.xrc
  
  I am working on a gentoo ebuild, but they get added very slowly, so it may
  take some time before it is added to portage. Still, if you use gentoo, you
  might try 'emerge hack4u' and see what happens.

- Usage -
---------

  Using the program should (I hope) be fairly straightforward. Start the program
  hack4u either by double-clicking or from the command line.
  
  Load the SRAM .SAV file. For FCEU on Windows, this is in the FCEU directory
  in the SAV subdirectory. For FCEU on Unix, this is in the ~/.fceu directory. I
  don't know about other emulators. The program should work on any emulator that
  uses the battery backed RAM (SRAM).
  
  Once the file is open, it will load the first save game it finds. Ultima used
  three save slots, and you can edit any of the three that are available. I
  assume in most cases this will be the the first game "Game1". You can choose
  a different save slot from the Game menu. If any are greyed out, that means
  they are not valid. You must have at least one save in SRAM to edit, or the
  program will not be able to edit anything. We can only make changes to
  existing files. We cannot generate them.
  
  There are three tabs, "General", "Inventory", and "Character". They will allow
  you to edit almost any part of the game. Items you have, your characters
  stats, magic you know, etc.
  
  The one thing that cannot yet be edited (that I plan to implement) is
  characters waiting in Britannia's Hostel. If there is something you want to be
  able to edit that you cannot, contact me and I'll see what I can do.
  
  When you load a .SAV file, it will make a backup in a file named the same as
  your SRAM file with a .bak on the end. If something goes wrong when you try
  to start your edited game, just delete the SRAM file and rename the backup to
  .sav instead of .sav.bak.

- Notes -
---------

  Some important things to be aware of.
  
  - This is BETA software. Your use of it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take no
    responsibility if this program screws up your Ultima Data, or any other
    thing on your or any other computer. I'm pretty sure it won't, but don't
    blame me if it does!
    
  - The program does not yet support many validity checks. This means you can
    create combinations that are completely illegal in the game. You can also
    put in values that are way outside the possible range. I don't know what
    will happen in the game if you do this.
    
    Off the top of my head, here is a list of things to watch out for.
    
    Gold should be 0-9999. More than 9999 confuses the game.
    Inventory quantities should be 0-99. You can have 255 herbs, but I have not
        tested this thoroughly.
    Virtues should be 0-100 (0 = evil incarnate, 100 = avatar)
    The Hero's Name can consist of the following characters
        A-Z, a-z, '-', '!', and ' '. All others are invalid. The name must NOT
        exceed 5 characters. On Windows, this is enforced, but I don't know
        about other platforms.
    Equipping two weapons, bows, or armors at the same time may confuse the
        game. I haven't tested this condition, but I expect it will not be what
        you want.
    
  - The program is not well tested. I have made several changes to SRAM files
    and they have all worked flawlessly. However, I haven't tested every
    combination individually. So some parts may be broken.
    
  - I've never heard of the 'Wheel' or the 'Dagger'. Neither seem to be of much
    use, but maybe I just didn't know what to do with them.
